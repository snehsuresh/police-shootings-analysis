## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of police shooting incidents in the United States. The primary goal is to examine various aspects of the dataset, uncover patterns, and provide valuable insights into demographic disparities and predictive modeling.

## Contents

- **Code:** The primary code file is washington_post_analysis.ipynb, which covers a wide range of analyses and visualizations.
- **Notebook:** The relevant findings from the ipynb file are discussed in the final report.
- **Data:** The dataset used for this analysis is stored in [2023-10-17-washington-post-police-shootings-export.csv](2023-10-17-washington-post-police-shootings-export.csv).
- **Report:** A detailed summary of the analysis, insights, and conclusions can be found in "Report.pdf" 

## Key Examinations

1. **Body Camera Usage:**
   - Investigation into whether certain police departments show a higher rate of incidents with no body camera usage.

2. **Demographic Disparities:**
   - Analysis of differences in the mean age between different racial groups using statistical tests and visualizations.

3. **Arms Used:**
   - Exploration of trends in the types of arms used by different races.

4. **Mental Illness Indicators:**
   - Examination of the prevalence of mental illness indicators across different racial groups.

5. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - Geographic analysis of police shooting incidents using GeoPandas and Folium.

6. **Machine Learning:**
   - Logistic Regression for predicting the type of arms used based on age.

7. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Utilization of DBSCAN for identifying spatial patterns in police shooting incidents.

## Insights and Conclusions

The findings and insights derived from this analysis are summarized in the [report.pdf](report.pdf). Each examination provides a unique perspective on the dataset, contributing to a holistic understanding of police shooting incidents.

## Note

The notebook file complements the main analysis by exploring all these aspects. Relevant insights from the notebook are discussed in detail in the final report.

Feel free to explore the code, notebook, and report for a detailed exploration of the analysis and its findings. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
